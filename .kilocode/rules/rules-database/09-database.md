# Instructions for database related tasks

This project uses a Postgres 17 database.
The name of the database is "musiciandb"

* The file doc/db-definition.sql contains the database schema description. Read this schema quietly.
* Use the tool `readonly_sql_query` to select data or additional schema information from the database. Show the query results in a human readable format.
* Use the tool `modifying_sql_statement`to modify data in the database.
* Use Mermaid to visualize ER diagrams. Make sure that the Mermaid syntax is correct. Do not use commas or dots in mermaid attribute names. Use simple names only.
